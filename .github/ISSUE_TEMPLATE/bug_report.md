We do not provide technical support

You MUST include a clear description of the bug and EXACT steps to reproduce the bug or IT WILL BE CLOSED:

1. Create a page
2. At Settings > Reading, set this page to your homepage
3. Open the page with Breakdance
4. Add a Heading element and set the color to dark green (00AA00 or darker)
5. Instead of seeing a dark green heading, I see a dinosaur and a message saying "you've turned back the clock".

The full text of any error messages are helpful. Screenshots are also helpful.

You should also include the following information:
 - Breakdance version
 - Browser & OS
 - If you receive any kind of error message, you should also provide your PHP and WordPress version
